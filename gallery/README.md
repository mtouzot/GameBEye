# Lens
*A Jekyll website  for photographers and photo bloggers.*

**Lens** is a photo gallery [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme designed
specially for photographers and photo bloggers.

Jekyll Lens uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) Static Site Generator (SSG) to
generate the website and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host it.

## Features

  ✅ Free & Easy setup  
  ✅ No coding required  

You won't need any expensive server, just to host a photo blog. You don't
even need to code anything. Just follow the steps below to setup your photo blog
in minutes.

1.  Enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) from the repository
